# Objects and Prototypes

## Understand the Difference between prototype, getPrototypeOf, and proto

## Prefer Object.getPrototypeOf to proto

## Never Modify proto

## Make Your Constructors new-Agnostic

## Store Methods on Prototypes

## Use Closures to Store Private Data

## Store Instance State Only on Instance Objects

## Recognize the Implicit Binding of this

## Call Superclass Constructors from Subclass Constructors

## Never Reuse Superclass Property Names

## Avoid Inheriting from Standard Classes

## Treat Prototypes As an Implementation Detail

## Avoid Reckless Monkey-Patching
