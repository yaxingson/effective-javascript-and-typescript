# Concurrency

## Don’t Block the Event Queue on I/O

## Use Nested or Named Callbacks for Asynchronous Sequencing

## Be Aware of Dropped Errors

## Use Recursion for Asynchronous Loops

## Don’t Block the Event Queue on Computation

## Use a Counter to Perform Concurrent Operations

## Never Call Asynchronous Callbacks Synchronously

## Use Promises for Cleaner Asynchronous Logic
